# mstsegment

A minimum spanning tree-based algorithm for separating image backgrounds.
Created by Jonathan Christopher for the author's Discrete Mathematics class paper.

## How to run

Prerequisites: Python with Pillow and NumPy modules.
Run `main.py` using Python. The algorithm may take up to several seconds to run.
Edit `main.py` to change input image and other parameters.

## Acknowledgements

The author thanks Dra. Harlili S. M.Sc. as the lecturer of the author’s Discrete Mathematics class, for guidance in preparing this paper. The author would also like to thank the developers and contributors of the open-source Pillow Python image library and NumPy scientific computing library, which has greatly simplified the author’s implementation of the image segmentation and background separation algorithm.
